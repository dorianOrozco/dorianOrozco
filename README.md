I build web applications with .NET, always trying to follow clean architecture and good programming patterns. I’ve been messing with RTSP cameras, MediaMTX, and working on projects that mix backend logic with real-time visuals.

### Constantly Using

One of the cooler applications I've built revolves around capturing still images from RTSP cameras located around the workplace, making them accessible to users who create and manage orders. It includes an approval based system, in-app notifications, third party login via microsoft, user roles, automated emailing, responsive pages and more. 

Everything updates in real-time using SignalR and a lot of JavaScript to catch ALL edge cases... I hope. What I really enjoy about this app is that it creates a streamlined and guided workflow ensuring smooth orders for the individuals packaging, and the users approving.

### Currently Improving

Lately I've been brushing up on Angular, TypeScript and SASS in preperation for a front-end role. Since I've spent most of my time on the backend, I'm using my experience with structuring, architecture and problem solving skills to help me improve my skills quicker. 

I’m planning on creating a new app using a stack I’m excited about: Angular, TypeScript, SASS, .NET, and PostgreSQL. I'm excited to build fresh from scratch and put it all into practice.
