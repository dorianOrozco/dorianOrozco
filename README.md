I started my developer career building full-stack web applications with .NET Core. This technology gave me a great understanding of building web applications and APIs using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.

</a>

One of the cooler applications I've built revolved around capturing still images from RTSP cameras located around the workplace, making them accessible to users who create and manage orders. It includes an approval based system, real-time in-app notifications, third party login, user roles, automated emails, responsive design and much more. 

### Where I am now

After a year of designing, building and maintaining web applications, I transitioned into a front-end development role; a move that has helped me grow into a more well-rounded full-stack developer. 

I'm currently maintaining and designing Angular applications that manage and support industrial machines across the globe. From the Americas, to Europe and Austrailia.
